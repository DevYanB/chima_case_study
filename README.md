Chima Case Study


Due Date: 15th October, 5pm PST


Background:

GenContentHub is on a mission - with their state-of-the-art "Llama 2" generative AI model, they aim to revolutionize digital marketing. The goal is a platform where clients not only get generated slogans but also fine-tune the AI's creativity, tone, and style.


Objective:

Your challenge is to design and deploy an MVP for GenContentHub that:


Interactive AI Tuning: Users should be able to adjust parameters like creativity level, tone, and style 


Feedback Loop: Allows users to provide feedback on generated slogans, which could be used for future model training 


Batch Generation & Selection: Provide an option to generate multiple slogans and let the user select their favorite 


Secure Payment System: Implement a seamless payment system 


Tasks:


Front-end Development:


Create a sophisticated user interface where they not only input keywords but also adjust AI parameters like creativity level, tone (e.g., formal, casual), and style (e.g., humorous, direct)


Present multiple slogans generated by the AI, allowing users to select their preferred ones



API & AI Model Integration:


Embed the Llama 2 AI model, ensuring it can adapt in real-time to user-defined parameters


Implement a feedback mechanism where users can rate or comment on the generated slogans, storing this data for potential model refinement



Model Fine-tuning & Feedback Loop:


Allow a mechanism to use accumulated feedback to refine and retrain the Llama 2 model periodically. Illustrate how this feedback loop could improve the quality of generated content over time



Payment Integration:


Set up a payment gateway, charging users based on the number of slogans they select or download


Ensure transaction details are not only secure but also transparent to users



Advanced OS & Server Setup:


Deploy the platform, ensuring it can handle high traffic and simultaneous AI operations without latency issues


Layer in strong security features, especially around user feedback, AI model parameters, and payment details


Deliverables:


A functional MVP of GenContentHub


Annotated source code


A report detailing:


Challenges related specifically to integrating and fine-tuning the generative AI


Considerations for handling large-scale user interactions with the AI model


Proposals for leveraging user feedback for continuous AI improvement


Evaluation Criteria:


AI Interaction: How seamlessly can users interact with and influence the AI model's outputs?


Code & Model Quality: Is the code well-structured? How effectively is the AI model integrated and fine-tuned?


User Experience: Does the platform offer a deep, intuitive interaction with the AI's generative capabilities?


Feedback Utility: How effectively is user feedback harnessed for potential model improvements?


Problem-solving: Emphasis on challenges tied to the AI's nuances
